"Caribbean Blue"
by ENYA

So the world goes round and round
With all you ever knew
They say the sky high above
Is Caribbean blue

If every man says all he can
If every man is true
Do I believe the sky above
Is Caribbean blue

If all they told was turned to gold
If all you dreamed was new
Imagine the sky high above
In Caribbean blue
